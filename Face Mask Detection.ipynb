        "# Face Mask Detection Using YOLOV5\n",
        "\n",
        "Tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/the-practical-guide-for-object-detection-with-yolov5-algorithm-74c04aac4843\n",
        "\n",
        "Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is a simple guide to training a face mask detector using YOLOV5. As the dataset used is small, we do not train the model from scratch, but apply transfer learning instead. After training the model, it can be exported to various formats for convenience. \n",
        "\n",
        "To train a face mask detector:\n",
        "1. Download the dataset from the Kaggle link above into your project folder.\n",
        "2. Run the `createLabel.py` script to convert the annotations into the correct format.\n",
        "3. Split the images and labels into train-validation-test with your desired ratio. Follow the directory format shown in the tutorial under the Data Handling section.\n",
        "4. Run the code below.\n",
        "\n",
        "To make predictions using a pretrained model:\n",
        "1. In the last cell of this notebook, change the `--source` argument to the directory containing the images (relative to the directory of this notebook).\n",
        "2. Execute the last cell. Results are saved to the `runs_mask/detect_test` folder.\n",
        "\n",
        "Potential issues:\n",
        "1. Out of memory when training model\n",
        "Fix: If you are training locally, try reducing batch size (argument `--batch-size`, default 16) or number of workers (argument `--workers`, default 8). If problem persists, train model on Google Colab instead. Remember to allocate GPU before training to speed up training.\n",
        "2. Issue with wandb\n",
        "Fix: If authentication is required, login to wandb to request for a key. If it is some other error, it might be a network issue, so check your connection or try running the cell again until it works.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note:\n",
        "1. The YOLOv5 github repository has been included with this project in the `yolov5` folder. Hence, there is no need to clone the repository.\n",
        "2. Changes made to the original YOLOv5 repository include:\n",
        "    1. Adding `mask.yaml` in the `data` folder.\n",
        "    2. Changing the `nc` parameter in `yolov5s.yaml` to 3, since there are 3 classes of labels."
